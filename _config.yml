  desc:  At one point I used to herd goats and farm in my extended familyâ€™s land back in Sudan. Fast-forward some 15
years and I am doing research on advanced control methodologies and robotics. Still wonder how that came to
be. As for my profile, currently I mainly work with nonlinear control, and model predictive control with focus on
the digital implementation aspects from a methodological point of view. My current passion is control problems
in robotics. I have also worked on controls and automation implementation via different tools and platforms on
different settings from the sugar manufacturing to humanoid robots!  # Describe yourself.
