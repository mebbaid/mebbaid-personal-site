At one point I used to herd goats and farm in my extended family’s land back in Sudan. Fast-forward some
15 years and I am doing research and engineering on advanced control methodologies and robotics. Still wonder how that
came to be. As for my profile, currently I mainly work with nonlinear control, and model predictive control with
focus on control problems in robotics. I have worked on Humanoid robot avatars, wheeled robots locomotion and loco-manipulation,
controls and automation implementation via different tools and platforms on different settings for different sizes of clients from Kenana
Sugar factory and ethanol plants to collaborating with Honda research Japan in robotic avatars.
