## About Me

I obtained my bachelor and master degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano (Milan, IT) in 2013 and 2015. I completed my Ph.D. in Bioengineering and Robotics at Universit√† degli Studi di Genova (Genoa, IT) in 2020. Presently, I am a Post-doctoral Researcher at the [Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence Laboratory](https://ami.iit.it/it/), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Genoa, IT).

My primary research focuses on the analysis and design of whole-body flight controllers for humanoid robots, specifically within the Aerial Humanoid Robotics research area. As the Scrum Master and technical coordinator of the [iRonCub](https://ami.iit.it/it/aerial-humanoid-robotics) group, my goal is to enable the humanoid robot iCub to attain flight capabilities.
