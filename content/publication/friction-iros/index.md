abstract: > 
  A common architecture for torque controlled humanoid robots consists in two nested loops. The outer loop generates desired joint/motor torques, and the inner loop stabilizes these desired values. In doing so, the inner loop usually compensates for joint friction phenomena, thus removing their inherent stabilizing property that may be also beneficial for high level control objectives. This paper shows how to exploit friction for joint and task space control of humanoid robots. Experiments are carried out on the humanoid robot iCub.
