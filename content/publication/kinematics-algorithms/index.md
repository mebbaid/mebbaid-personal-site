abstract: > 
  This paper contributes towards the development of motion tracking algorithms for time-critical applications, proposing an infrastructure for dynamically solving the inverse kinematics of highly articulate systems such as humans. The method presented is model-based, it makes use of velocity correction and differential kinematics integration in order to compute the system configuration. The convergence of the model towards the measurements is proved using Lyapunov analysis. An experimental scenario, where the motion of a human subject is tracked in static and dynamic configurations, is used to validate the inverse kinematics method performance on human and humanoid models. Moreover, the method is tested on a human-humanoid retargeting scenario, verifying the usability of the computed solution in real-time robotics applications. Our approach is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and computational load, and compared to iterative optimization algorithms.
