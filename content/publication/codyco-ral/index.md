abstract: > 
  The success of robots in real-world environments is largely dependent on their ability to interact with both humans and said environment. The FP7 EU project CoDyCo focused on the latter of these two challenges by exploiting both rigid and compliant contacts dynamics in the robot control problem. Regarding the former, to properly manage interaction dynamics on the robot control side, an estimation of the human behaviors and intentions is necessary. In this letter, we present the building blocks of such a human-in-the-loop controller, and validate them in both simulation and on the iCub humanoid robot using a human-robot interaction scenario. In this scenario, a human assists the robot in standing up from being seated on a bench.
