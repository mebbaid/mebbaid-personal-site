abstract: > 
  The topic of physical human-robot interaction received a lot of attention from the robotics community because of many promising application domains. However, studying physical interaction between a robot and an external agent, like a human or another robot, without considering the dynamics of both the systems may lead to many shortcomings in fully exploiting the interaction. In this paper, we present a coupled-dynamics formalism followed by a sound approach in exploiting helpful interaction with a humanoid robot. In particular, we propose the first attempt to define and exploit the human help for the robot to accomplish a specific task. As a result, we present a task-based partner-aware robot control techniques. The theoretical results are validated by conducting experiments with two iCub humanoid robots involved in physical interaction.
