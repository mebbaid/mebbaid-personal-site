abstract: >
  Failure detection and fault tolerant control are fundamental safety features of any aerial vehicle. With the emer-gence of complex, multi-body flying systems such as jet-powered humanoid robots, it becomes of crucial importance to design fault detection and control strategies for these systems, too. In this paper we propose a fault detection and control framework for the flying humanoid robot iRonCub in case of loss of one turbine. The framework is composed of a failure detector based on turbines rotational speed, a momentum-based flight control for fault response, and an offline reference generator that produces far-from-singularities configurations and accounts for self and jet exhausts collision avoidance. Simulation results with Gazebo and MATLAB prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
